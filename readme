Attached are my solutions to the two problems given.

Please Note that I had some doubts on what was expected in problem one:

1) It is asked to return the correct change. But a correct change can be

or cannot be optimal in terms of numbers of coins.

2) Due to this open ended nature I came up with two solutions :-

The first one uses a Greedy approach and give a correct change int terms of
given coins but the solution may or may not be optimal. On the bright side
it solves the problem in O(1) time and space ( O(1) not theoretically but a practical
approximation for small inputs).

The second approach used dynamic programming to achieve an optimal and
Correct solution but in doing so trades of efficiency in terms of both
Time and space.

The output is a list with 

First - the number of 25 coins
Second - the number of 10 coins
Third - the number of 5 coins
Fourth - the number of 1 coins

How to run with different test cases?

For the first problem just change the amount in the main function.

For the second problem just change the stock prices array.
